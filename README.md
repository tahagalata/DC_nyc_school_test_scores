# DataCamp Project: Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
## Project Description
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

### You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance: 

* Which schools produce the highest math scores? (Specifically, which schools have an average math SAT score of at least 80%?)
* Who are the top 10 schools based on average results across reading, math, and writing?
* Which NYC borough has the largest standard deviation for SAT results?
